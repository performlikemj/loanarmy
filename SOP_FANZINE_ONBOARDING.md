# SOP: Fanzine Partner Onboarding (Loan Army)

## Purpose
Ensure fanzine partners can reliably submit loan‑player writeups with clear attribution, correct coverage permissions, and consistent publishing outcomes.

## Scope
Applies to any external partner (fanzine/blog/podcast) writing about a loaned player (e.g., on loan from Manchester United).

## Roles
- **Admin (you)**: creates accounts, assigns coverage, approves manual players, verifies setup.
- **Partner Writer(s)**: submit writeups and/or manual player requests.
- **Editor (optional)**: reviews before publish if you run a moderated workflow.

## Preconditions
- Admin access + admin key configured.
- Partner contact + agreed cadence (weekly, matchday, etc.).
- Attribution details ready (name + URL).

## Decision: Publishing Model
Choose one:
- **Direct publishing (recommended)**: partner writes in the app.
- **Assisted publishing**: partner sends writeups to you; you post them.

Decision criteria:
- Direct publishing if they can log in and you want speed and scale.
- Assisted publishing if you want tighter editorial control or it’s a short trial.

## SOP A: Direct Publishing (Partner writes in app)

### A1) Create or invite journalist account
- [ ] Create a journalist account for each writer (or one shared org account).
- [ ] Confirm email address and display name.

### A2) Set attribution
- [ ] Attribution Name (e.g., “Fanzine Name”).
- [ ] Attribution URL (canonical site).
- [ ] Verify attribution appears on profile + byline after save.

### A3) Assign coverage
- [ ] Admin → Users → locate writer → **Edit Coverage**.
- [ ] Add **Loan Teams** coverage for the fanzine’s club (incoming loans).
- [ ] Optional: add **Parent Clubs** coverage for Manchester United.
- [ ] Save coverage.
- [ ] Reopen coverage dialog to confirm assignments persist.

### A4) Confirm player tracking
- [ ] If the player is missing, writer uses **Suggest Player**.
- [ ] Admin approves with an admin note.
- [ ] Writer sees “Approved” status and admin note in **My Submissions**.

### A5) Writeup workflow
- [ ] Writer creates a new writeup and publishes.
- [ ] Verify it appears on:
  - Journalist profile
  - Player/team page (if applicable)
  - Newsletter view (if included)

### A6) Cadence + quality
- [ ] Agree cadence and format (matchday recap, weekly summary, etc.).
- [ ] Provide any style guide or length expectations.

### A7) Ongoing checks
- [ ] Monthly check: attribution still correct.
- [ ] Quarterly check: coverage still accurate.

## SOP B: Assisted Publishing (Partner sends drafts to you)

### B1) Collect writeups
- [ ] Collect via email or shared doc.
- [ ] Confirm author name + attribution details.

### B2) Post writeups
- [ ] Post under your account or a shared “Fanzine” account.
- [ ] Ensure attribution fields match the partner.

### B3) Confirm visibility
- [ ] Verify the writeup appears on the public pages + newsletter view.

### B4) Review cadence
- [ ] Reassess after 4 weeks; migrate to direct publishing if consistent.

## Verification Checklist (Bulletproof)
Run this after onboarding:
- [ ] Writer can log in and access **Writer Dashboard**.
- [ ] Attribution name + URL render on profile and byline.
- [ ] Coverage assignments persist after reload.
- [ ] Manual player submission can be created and approved.
- [ ] Approved submission shows “Approved” + admin note to writer.
- [ ] Writeup is visible to end users in expected places.

---

## Exception Handling
- **Missing player**: use Suggest Player → Admin approval.
- **Wrong coverage**: Admin updates coverage; re‑verify.
- **Attribution incorrect**: update profile fields; re‑verify byline.
- **Publishing mistake**: unpublish or edit writeup; notify partner.

---

## Security & Access
- No shared personal logins unless explicitly approved.
- If using a shared org account, store credentials in a secure manager.

---

## Definition of Done
- Partner can submit a writeup end‑to‑end without admin intervention.
- Attribution and coverage are correct.
- First published piece is visible to end users.
