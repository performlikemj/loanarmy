- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Add negative-case tests for journalist commentary workflows (invalid type, missing player_id, non-writer access).
  - Success: Tests enforce correct 400/403 responses and pass.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow AGENTS.md conventions; tests-first for new features/bugfixes.
  - Keep compatibility with existing journalist assignment behavior.
- Key decisions:
  - Validate commentary_type and player_id early in `/writer/commentaries` to return 400 on invalid input.
- State:
  - Done:
    - Added negative-case tests for invalid type, missing player_id, and non-writer access.
    - Updated commentary creation/update validation to return 400 for invalid type/missing player_id.
    - Ran pytest for new negative-case tests (all passing).
  - Now:
    - Ready to summarize changes.
  - Next:
    - Optional: run full `tests/test_journalist_coverage.py` suite again.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None.
