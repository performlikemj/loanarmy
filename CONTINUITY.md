- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Fix writer editor "New Writeup" crash (TypeError: f.map is not a function) so the dialog loads reliably.
  - Success: writer editor opens without runtime errors; tests added and passing.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow AGENTS.md conventions and Continuity Ledger rules.
  - Write failing tests first, run them, then implement until green.
- Key decisions:
  - None yet.
- State:
  - Done:
    - Added normalizeWriterTeams helper to handle object/array writer team payloads.
    - Updated WriteupEditor to normalize writer teams before rendering.
    - Added frontend tests for normalization; `pnpm test -- --runInBand` passes.
    - Fixed AdminTeams alias description to avoid JSX arrow warning; added tests.
    - Implemented loan-team direction filtering in WriteupEditor; added tests for direction params.
    - Updated writer team normalization to include parent/loan metadata and UI badges.
    - Frontend tests pass (`pnpm test -- --runInBand`).
  - Now:
    - Report loan-team direction filtering implementation and test status.
  - Next:
    - (If needed) extend writer editor to support loan-team direction filtering.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - Should loan-team assignments appear in the WriteupEditor team list (requires loaned_to direction)?
