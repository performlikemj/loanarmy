- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Fix lower-league team support for writers: auto-sync fixtures, backfill raw_json, cache team names
  - Success: Writers see up-to-date stats with proper team names, same as public endpoint
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow AGENTS.md conventions and Continuity Ledger rules.
- Key decisions:
  - Writer stats endpoint now auto-syncs missing fixtures from API-Football
  - New admin endpoint to backfill raw_json for fixtures missing it
  - resolve_team_name_and_logo now caches to TeamProfile after API lookups
  - Added force_sync parameter to public player stats endpoint
- State:
  - Done:
    - Added auto-sync logic to journalist stats endpoint (journalist.py)
    - Created admin endpoint /admin/fixtures/backfill-raw-json (api.py)
    - Enhanced resolve_team_name_and_logo to cache team names in TeamProfile
    - Added force_sync query param to /players/<id>/stats endpoint
    - Deployed to production (2x deploys)
    - Verified: J. Moorhouse now shows 22 fixtures including Dec 26 vs Peterborough
    - Verified: All team names resolved (Burton Albion, Aston Villa U21, Cardiff, etc.)
  - Now:
    - Complete
  - Next:
    - Monitor writer interface for any remaining issues
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - loan-army-backend/src/routes/journalist.py (auto-sync)
  - loan-army-backend/src/routes/api.py (backfill endpoint + team caching + force_sync)
  - Force sync command: GET /api/players/344229/stats?force_sync=true
